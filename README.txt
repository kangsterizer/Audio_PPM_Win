Plug a mono or stereo audio jack into your transmitter (turned off) and the PC INPUT audio port and click "detect PPM amplitude".
Plug it now into the PC OUTPUT audio port, and start the transmitter.
Use it into Master Mode, and preferrably with P-LINK enabled. P-LINK ensures that your transmitter takes care of the mixing and the trimming.
